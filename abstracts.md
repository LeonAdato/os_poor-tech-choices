# Abstracts, Briefs, and Pitch
What follows are the elements most conferences require in a CFP. Feel free to use, modify, or ignore as your personal style and tastes dictate. 

## Brief (~300 char)
Watching your technology choice go down the drain - because of broken promises, vendor implosion, or obsolescence - can feel like a career-ending experience. But in my experience there's usually a lot of good that comes out of those seemingly bad tech choices.

## Abstract
Working in tech is a never-ending stream of choices: from the language, platform, and framework we use to the vendors we put our trust (and money) in. Many of us live in fear that our next choice will turn sour, and will end up being a resume-generating event for us. 

In reality, there is often a lot more good than you'd expect from those seemingly bad tech choices. In this session, I'll look back on several failed implementations, poor calls, and wasted weekends to see, with the benefit of hindsight, how they turned out to be decent decisions after all. 

## Pitch
*NOTE: This answers the question, "Why should someone attend? Why are you the right person to speak on this topic?*

With over xx years experience in I.T. spanning over yy companies, I've seen my fair share of paradigm shifts, vaporware embarrassments, and even a few came-out-of-nowhere surprises. In that amount of time, it's impossible have made nothing but correct guesses and good choices. 

But with hindsight, a healthy dose of humor, a couple years' of therapy, and a fair bit of drinking, I'm able to reflect on those choices and see where a seemingly bad outcome obscured the valuable skills, knowledge, and experience that I picked up along the way.
