# README for the open Source version of the "Lifetime of Poor Technical Choices" conference talk.

## Description
After delivering this talk in front of a couple of audiences, it has become abundantly clear that not only do LOTS of people have similar stories, EVERYONE could probably speak to this topic! Moreover, if you lined up any number of people to give this talk, each one would be completely unique and utterly compelling.

Which is why I've decided to take the bones of this talk and make it open source. The concept is now free and available for everyone to use, build upon, rif on, and generally play around with.

## Usage
I've provided a PDF version just for viewing, plus a PPTX and ODP version that should at least get you started importing it into your slide tool of choice.

What should become obvious fairly quickly is that the slides I've provided are just the skeleton of the talk. It's up to each user to fill in with the details of their "poor choice", the lesson(s) they learned, and how it ultimately turned out to be not such a bad choice after all.

As I state at the top of the Abstracts document, you should free to use, modify, or ignore all, some, or none of what I've provided, as your personal style and tastes dictate.
